# Flashcards_exploratory_random

Taking Flashcards_exploratory a bit further by implementing a random return (question) on the terminal.

I have explored two patterns for managing classes: Inheritance and Composition.
Two example files in utils illustrate how this is done(composition_example.py, inheritance_example.py). Their resulting files are in the root directory.

## To run a prompt of three random questions

If you clone this repository, then you can navigate to the root directory in your terminal and run `python3 main.py` . You will be prompted for a username which is a stand-in for a log-in process.

## Next step

A back-end is needed to save card data and assign stacks to users. The cards will also save their score and therefore their repetition pattern.
